On each iteration of the supervisor's run loop, the supervisor Fetch the list of partitions from Kafka and determine the starting offset for each partition (either based on the last processed offset if continuing, or starting from the beginning or ending of the stream if this is a new topic )  There’s only one set of offsets, it’s the current checkpoint (what tasks should start reading from when they begin), and it gets updated when tasks successfully publish (or if you reset the supervisor).&#xA;&#xA;Ingestion is considered successful when the segment has been written into the metadata store and is &quot;published&quot;."/>
