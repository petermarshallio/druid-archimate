    documentation="Periodically they push data into deep storage &quot;unpublished&quot; as individual segments, not yet written into the metadata store.&#xA;&#xA;In streaming ingestion, when a checkpoint occurs (instructed by the overlord) they make a push of their current segment data to deep storage (bringing it to a head) and then call the Publish API on the overlord.  If this fails, the data is still in deep storage, but it remains unpublished and the task is marked as failed.&#xA;&#xA;Notice that realtime data exists as &quot;ghost segments&quot; and are still available for query (by announcements) even though they haven't been pushed.  If the task fails, therefore, this data might disappear - it is less stable than pushed / published data, and thus is a key reason for replicas for redundancy.  These &quot;ghost&quot; segments remain available for query until a historical has fully and completely loaded the segment, meaning that the data will always be available for query without interuption.&#xA;&#xA;Batch ingestion also push to deep storage (same as streaming) but the publish protocol is slightly different, in that this is handled by a supervisory task in the MM, not on the overlord, once all these subtasks have completed."/>
