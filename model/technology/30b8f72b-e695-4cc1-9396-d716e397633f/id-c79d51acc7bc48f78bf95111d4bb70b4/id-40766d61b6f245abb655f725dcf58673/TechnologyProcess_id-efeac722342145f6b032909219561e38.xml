    documentation="Notice that realtime data exists as &quot;ghost segments&quot; and are still available for query (by announcements) even though they haven't been pushed.  If the task fails, therefore, this data might disappear - it is less stable than pushed / published data, and thus is a key reason for replicas for redundancy.  These &quot;ghost&quot; segments remain available for query until a historical has fully and completely loaded the segment, meaning that the data will always be available for query without interuption."/>
