    documentation="MM and Indexers do ingestion and store the most recent (last hour or two) data.&#xA;&#xA;MiddleManager is in the middle of transfering to Indexers (alpha feature) - there's no strong push to use it currently.&#xA;&#xA;There are two types of ingestion: seekable-stream and batch.&#xA;&#xA;In stream ingestion, it runs individual ingestion tasks, builds a segment and pushes it into deep storage.  This is monitored by a supervisor that is running on the overlord.  Tasks will be created and have partition assignments within the stream and each independently do the ingestion work.&#xA;&#xA;In batch ingestion, a supervisor task is created within this process itself, controlling up to maxNumConcurrentSubTasks of worker tasks.  Those workers read from the source, assigned to run particular sets of files.  When all the subtasks are done, it's this process that calls the Publish API on behalf of all those subtasks.&#xA;&#xA;These processes therefore scale based on how much data you'll be ingesting."/>
