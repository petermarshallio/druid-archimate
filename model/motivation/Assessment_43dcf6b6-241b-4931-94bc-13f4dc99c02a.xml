    documentation="The format of data as it comes into a data river is not always read to be consumed further downstream.  For example, it may be missing key contextual or calculated data elements that need to be added (enrichment), or its format may need to be changed (from JSON to CSV).&#xA;&#xA;At Game Analytics, they solved this proble, by using an Erlang event-processing system just downstream of the incoming events.&#xA;&#xA;Because statistical calculations are not meant for traditional databases, statistics must be calculated, and this can take a long time.  The workaround is to calculate specific statistics that are most likely to be used, but this takes time.  The need for accuracy, especially on high-volume, high-speed data, is presumed, which prevents business-people from making a decision about whether it is required and leads to complex, slow, and ultimately very expensive systems (if any at all)."/>
