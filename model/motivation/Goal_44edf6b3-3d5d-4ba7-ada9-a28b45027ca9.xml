    documentation="The history of IT teaches that accuracy is at the core of everything we do.  However, psychology suggests that instinctive decisions made on the latest and greatest information available about recent history are often informed by, not determined by, data.  THis is not to say that accuracy is REQUIRED, but that it is an OPTION.&#xA;&#xA;Further, that when bins are being used and figures are being presented in rounded or truncated form, accuracy is absolutely not required."/>
